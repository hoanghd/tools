The best names are ones that can’t be misconstrued—the person reading your code will understand it the way you meant it, 
and no other way. Unfortunately, a lot of English words are ambiguous when it comes to programming, such as filter, length, 
and limit.

Before you decide on a name, play devil’s advocate and imagine how your name might be misunderstood. 
The best names are resistant to misinterpretation.

When it comes to defining an upper or lower limit for a value, max_ and min_ are good prefixes to use. 
For inclusive ranges, first and last are good. 
For inclusive/exclusive ranges, begin and end are best because they’re the most idiomatic.

When naming a boolean, use words like is and has to make it clear that it’s a boolean. 
Avoid negated terms (e.g., disable_ssl). Beware of users’ expectations about certain words. 
For example, users may expect get() or size() to be lightweight methods.
